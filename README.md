Pi-Day-Challenge
================
An application developed for the Pi Day memorization contest in which people try to recite digits of pi. It checks the user input against a file and stops them as soon as they get a digit incorrect. Starts after the decimal point.

Pressing F5 resets the attempt progress, preparing it for a new attempt.
